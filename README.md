# Takoc V1

First, let me explain a bit about Takoc's background. Takoc aims to create a type system that enables high-level
programming across multiple programming languages. It seeks to provide a unified language, data model, and interaction
approach for managing code and projects.

But implementing so many features is not realistic. I have tried many frameworks and realized that it is not possible to
design everything in one go. Therefore, the goal for Takoc V1 is very simple: to **Create a Typescript project that
manages itself**.

Of course, even this task alone is quite challenging, despite the fact that there are already many ways in the community
to work with TypeScript projects.

So, in V1, the entire process will also be broken down into many smaller User Stories to be completed:

1. Generate `constructor` method
2. TODO

## Story-1 Generate `constructor` method

### Task-1-1 Generate `constructor` method for literal type
### Task-1-2 Generate `constructor` method for string type with check rule
### Task-1-3 Generate `constructor` method for interface type

## Story-2 Auto-Generated Mechanism

### Task-2-1 Extract `checker` from check method
