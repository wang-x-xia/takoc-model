# Type

Of course, Type is an important thing to describe data.

In Takoc, we try to use a simple way to describe a type: name and description.

For example:

* name: text
* description: A readable string

Each data can be described with one or more types. But usually use one type for a given data.

In many cases, we need some parameterized type, such as generic,
the [Type Constraint](Type%20Constraint.md) should be defined.

The types should be managed by [Module](./Module.md).
